    Description:
    </h1>
    

<p>


As most of the current hotel reservation systems are file based ones, management of the hotel has to put much effort on securing those files. They can easily get damaged by any hazard. Also keeping files managed is a time consuming task. For that, the hotel management system will almost cover all the basic processes done in a hotel. so shifting to an online system would result in saving of time, man hours and it would also reduce space wastage, thus will increase the efficiency in hotel's daily activities.

    Deployment Cost:
</h1>

<p>


The development cost can be divided into 3 sections, economical, structural and operational. Economically, the system will include the software development cost which will range from at least Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 150,000 as per the market competitive cost for 3 developers in the group. But as the system will most likely work as an alternative to the file based system, there will be cost of either hiring new staff or the cost of time of study for existing staff in order to handle the virtual features of the system. All this will additionally estimate to about Rs. 100,000.

Structurally, the system may require an increase in infrastructural space in order to facilitate the hiring of new staff which will handle the online system. The project will also be feasible within the limits of current technology as it will be a web application.

Operationally, the system will either require for new staff to be hired by the organization which is using the system or to teach the existing staff.
